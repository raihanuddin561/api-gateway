# Desciption
By providing cross-cutting issues like security, monitoring/metrics, and robustness to APIs, Spring Cloud Gateway seeks to make routing to APIs simple yet effective. An API gateway is a solution for managing APIs that lies between a client and a group of backend services. A reverse proxy accepts all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregates the numerous services necessary to fulfill them, and returns the appropriate result.
